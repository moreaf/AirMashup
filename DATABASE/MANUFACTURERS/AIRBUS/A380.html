<h3><font color='blue' style='font-family: Helvetica;'>Development and production</font></h3>
<pre><font style='font-family: Helvetica;'>The Airbus A380 is the world's largest passenger airliner, a wide-body
aircraft manufactured by Airbus. Airbus studies started in 1988 and the
project was announced in 1990 to challenge the dominance of the Boeing
747 in the long haul market. The A3XX project was presented in 1994;
Airbus launched the €9.5 billion ($10.7 billion) A380 programme on 19
December 2000. The first prototype was unveiled in Toulouse on 18
January 2005, with its first flight on 27 April 2005. It obtained its EASA
and FAA type certificates on 12 December 2006. Difficulties in electrical
wiring caused a two-year delay and the development cost ballooned to
€18 billion.

It was first delivered to Singapore Airlines on 15 October 2007 and
entered service on 25 October. Production peaked at 30 per year in
2012 and 2014. However, Airbus concedes that its $25 billion
investment for the aircraft cannot be recouped. On 14 February 2019,
after Emirates reduced its last orders in favour of the A350 and the
A330neo, Airbus announced that A380 production would end by 2021.

The full-length double-deck aircraft has a typical seating capacity of 525,
though it is certified for up to 853 passengers. It is powered by four
Engine Alliance GP7200 or Rolls-Royce Trent 900 turbofans providing
a range of 8,000 nmi (14,800 km). As of February 2019, Airbus has
received 290 firm orders and delivered 235 aircraft; Emirates is the
biggest A380 customer with 123 ordered, of which 109 have been
delivered.</font></pre>
