<h3><font color='blue' style='font-family: Helvetica;'>Development and production</font></h3>
<pre><font style='font-family: Helvetica;'>The Boeing 767 is a mid- to large-size, mid- to long-range, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner developed
and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was Boeing's first wide-body twinjet and its first
airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has two turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for
reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than
earlier aircraft such as the 747, the 767 has a seating capacity for 181 to 375 people, and a design
range of 3,850 to 6,385 nautical miles (4,431 to 7,348 mi; 7,130 to 11,825 km), depending on variant.
Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow-body twinjet, the 757, resulting in shared
design features which allow pilots to obtain a common type rating to operate both aircraft.

United Airlines first placed the 767 in commercial service in 1982. The aircraft was initially flown on
domestic and transcontinental routes, during which it demonstrated the reliability of its twinjet design.
The 767 became the first twin-engined airliner to be used on extended overseas flights in 1985. The
aircraft was then used to expand non-stop service on medium- to long-haul intercontinental routes. In
1986, Boeing initiated studies for a higher-capacity 767, ultimately leading to the development of the 777,
a larger wide-body twinjet. In the 1990s, the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for
transatlantic flights between North America and Europe.

The 767 is the first twinjet wide-body type to reach 1,000 aircraft delivered. As of May 2019, Boeing
has received 1,248 orders for the 767 from 74 customers with 1,151 delivered.A total of 742 of these
aircraft were in service in July 2018.The most popular variant is the 767-300ER with 583 delivered.
Delta Air Lines is the largest operator with 77 aircraft. Competitors have included the Airbus A300, A310,
and A330-200. Non-passenger variants of the 767 remain in production as of 2019 while the passenger
variant's successor, the 787, entered service in 2011.
